Docker is available for many different operating systems. You may use Docker as your Container Engine on Windows, macOS and Linux workstations. You can install it by following their [Installation per distro](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to get Docker and you can install Docker Compose by following these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Once you have docker installed and or already have it installed.

You can start the app by running this commands

```sh
docker-compose up
```

If you would like to run docker for development in the root project folder rename to `docker-compose.override.dev` to `docker-compose.override`
